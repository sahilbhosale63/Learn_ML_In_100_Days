Learn Machine Learning #100DaysOfMLCode

# Day 01

Today's Progress: I refreshed the basics topics of linear algebra like vectors, linear combination, linear transformation, matrix multipication and determinants from the 3Blue1Brown youtube channel.

Thought: I would be enhancing my maths skills first and then start with the actual machine learning concepts. 

# Day 02

Today's Progress: Learned the concepts of linear algebra like Inverse matrix, column space, null space, non-square matrix, dot product and cross product from the 3Blue1Brown youtube channel.

Thought: Currently I am gaining the basic understanding of the topics in linear algebra and after this I will be diving deep into these topics.


# Day 03

Today's Progress: Learned the concepts of linear algebra like cross product in linear transformation, change in basis, Eignvalues and Eigenvectors and abstract vector space from the 3Blue1Brown youtube channel.

Thought: Completed the 3Blue1Brown videos and from tomorrow will learn this subject in detail.


# Day 04

Today's Progress: 
Lecture 1
N linear equations with n unknown,  Row picture , column picture, matrix form

Lecture 2
Elimation of matrix by row, back substitution, matrix multiplication, inverse of a matrix
