# Day 05

**Today's Progress:** Completed the 3rd & 4th lectures from the MIT OpenCourseWare's Linear Algebra course.

**Lecture 3:** Multiplication of matrix 4 ways: row *col , row * matrix, matrix * col, col * row( It's a special case ).
Inverse of a matrix ( A^-1 A = I ), if and only if A^-1 exist and finding inverse i.e A^-1 by gauss - Jordan Elimination method.
Also, A^-1 A = I = A A^-1, i.e A inverse * A is same as A * A inverse which is equal to identity matrix (I).

**Lecture 4:** Factorization of matrix also known as matrix decomposition Is a way of reducing a matrix into constituent parts and in the form A = LU ( where L is lower triangular matrix and U is upper triangular matrix). More details here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/introduction-to-matrix-decompositions-for-machine-learning/

Inverse of two matrix i.e AB is B^-1A^-1 AB = I.
To find transpose of a matrix we make row as a column and vice-versa.
