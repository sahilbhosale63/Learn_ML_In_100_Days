# Day 01

Today's Progress: I refreshed the basics topics of linear algebra like vectors, linear combination, linear transformation, matrix multipication and determinants from the 3Blue1Brown youtube channel.

Thought: I would be enhancing my maths skills first and then start with the actual machine learning concepts. 

# Day 02

Today's Progress: Learned the concepts of linear algebra like Inverse matrix, column space, null space, non-square matrix, dot product and cross product from the 3Blue1Brown youtube channel.

Thought: Currently I am gaining the basic understanding of the topics in linear algebra and after this I will be diving deep into these topics.
