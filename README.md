# Day 01

**Today's Progress:** I refreshed the basics topics of linear algebra like vectors, linear combination, linear transformation, matrix multipication and determinants from the 3Blue1Brown youtube channel.

**Thought:** I would be enhancing my maths skills first and then start with the actual machine learning concepts. 

# Day 02

**Today's Progress:** Learned the concepts of linear algebra like Inverse matrix, column space, null space, non-square matrix, dot product and cross product from the 3Blue1Brown youtube channel.

**Thought:** Currently I am gaining the basic understanding of the topics in linear algebra and after this I will be diving deep into these topics.


# Day 03

**Today's Progress:** Learned the concepts of linear algebra like cross product in linear transformation, change in basis, Eignvalues and Eigenvectors and abstract vector space from the 3Blue1Brown youtube channel.

**Thought:** Completed the 3Blue1Brown videos and from tomorrow will learn this subject in detail.


# Day 04

**Today's Progress:** Completed the first 2 lectures from the MIT OpenCourseWare's [Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) Course and learned the following topics:

**Lecture 1:** N linear equations with n unknown,  Row picture , column picture, matrix form

**Lecture 2:** Elimination of matrix by row, back substitution, matrix multiplication, inverse of a matrix

**Thought:** Really understand this topics deeply as what matrix actually are and how to perform various operations on them. Looking forward to completed this course lectures in a week with proper understanding.


# Day 05

**Today's Progress:** Completed the 3rd & 4th lectures from the MIT OpenCourseWare's Linear Algebra course. Topics covered: Multiplication of matrix (4 ways), finding inverse of matrix i.e A^-1 by Gauss-Jordan Elimination method, Factorization into A = LU , Transpose of a matrix, Permutation matrix.

**Lecture 3:** Multiplication of matrix 4 ways: row *col , row * matrix, matrix * col, col * row( It's a special case ).
Inverse of a matrix ( A^-1 A = I ), if and only if A^-1 exist and finding inverse i.e A^-1 by gauss - Jordan Elimination method.
Also, A^-1 A = I = A A^-1, i.e A inverse * A is same as A * A inverse which is equal to identity matrix (I).

**Lecture 4:** Factorization of matrix also known as matrix decomposition Is a way of reducing a matrix into constituent parts and in the form A = LU ( where L is lower triangular matrix and U is upper triangular matrix). More details here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/introduction-to-matrix-decompositions-for-machine-learning/

Inverse of two matrix i.e AB is B^-1A^-1 AB = I.
To find transpose of a matrix we make row as a column and vice-versa.
In permutation matrix we exchange rows. Also, In permutatin matrix Inverse of a matrix is equal to its transpose ( P^-1 = P^T).

**Thought:** Getting some more grip on this subject as I am moving along.


# Day 06

**Today's Progress:** Learned about vector spaces and subspaces, column space and null space in linear algebra from @MIT OpenCourseWare lecture 5 and lecture 6.

Vectors Space has to be closed under Multiplication and addition of vectors which means in other words linear combination

How to create a subspace from a matrix?
Take the columns of a matrix and take there combinations or there linear combinations and you get the column space.

**Thought:** completed the vector spaces part of linear algebra.


# Day 07

**Today's Progress:** Learned about computing the nullspaces, Echelon form, complete solution of AX = B and rank of a matrix from MIT lecture 7 and lecture 8.
 

**Thought:** learning some advance stuff and getting it to the middle of linear algebra course.


# Day 08

**Today's Progress:** Learned about the Linear independence, basics and dimensions, rowspaces and Nullspace of A^T from the lecture 9 and 10 of the MIT open courseware.

**Thought:** The things which I learned today was new to me and I had never learned this in my school. There can be some topics from linear algebra which you might not know, so I encourage you all if you are learning mathematics or ML please check out this MIT Linear Algebra course link. The link is mentioned in Day 04.  

# Day 09

**Today's Progress:** Day 09: learned about Bases of new vector spaces, rank one matrix and basics of graphs in linear algebra from @MIT courseware lecture 11.

**Thought:** Watched only one video today because I was working on my internship web project.


# Day 10

**Today's Progress:**  Learned about the Graphs & Networks, Incidence matrix, proved Kirchoff's law in terms of a matrix and solved some sums related to what I have learned so far from the MIT open courseware lecture 12 and 13.

**Thought:** After solving the kirchoff's law in term of matrix form I think linear algebra can do anything. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :heart_eyes:


# Day 11
